# Introduction

In this project we were given a dataset consisting of statements and their emotions, our goal is to use different classifiers and prepreocessing methods from NLP to create models that are able to predict a sentence's associated emotion.

## Preprocessing

To solve this NLP problem we will employ some stages of preprocessing on our data, namely "Steaming and Tokenization" and "Lemmatization".
We then choose between two major preprocessing algorithms that we expected may give different results: "Bag of Words" and TF-IDF"

## NLP Algorithms

Naive Bayes, 

## Performance Evaluation

We want to measure which aproach reached the best results.
To do that we must define the metrics for comparison.

### Metrics

__TODO__ (performance on the test set, confusion matrix, precision,
recall, accuracy, F1 measure, time spent to train/test the models)

### Results

__TODO__
