# FEUP-IA_NLP
FEUP 3rd year 2nd semester
IA's second pratical work - Natural Language Processing

The project has only two directories:
 - res - contains the datasets used in the project as .csv files.
 - src - contains a jupyter notebook with the actual code and running instructions.

To test the program simply run the code blocks in the notebook as they appear and skip ahead whenever the instructions say so.
